## Description
This project will be a fun text-based choose-your-own-adventure game.

## Features
- Character Name Customization
	- The player will be asked to enter the name of their character, and this name will reoccur throughout the adventure.
- Branching Paths
	- At certain points in the adventure, the player will be provided a set of choices based on a prompt, and will be asked to choose one of the provided actions. 
    - The player's choices will diverge the path of the adventure, creating story branches and unique outcomes and endings.
- Character Class (if time permits)
	- The player will be given a small selection of "character classes" to select from at the beginning of the adventure. 
    - Class choice will have slight impacts on the text/adventure as well as present the player with additional action choices based on their class.
- NPC Name Customization (if time permits)
    - The player will be able to name certain NPCs and have these names reoccur (like naming rivals in Pok√©mon).

## Challenges
- I will need to refresh my memory on if, elif, and else statements, as well as the most efficient and concise ways to handle a surplus of them.
- I will need to learn and/or relearn how to handle text strings that include variables.
- It is likely I will face some challenges organizing my project into functions which can pull from each other. I will need to refresh myself on functions and function interaction.
- I could potentially research giving the player the ability to click on their desired answer and have the program respond accordingly, but I will likely just have the player input answer choices based on an assigned number or letter.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The project functions as a short, fun, choose-your-own-adventure game.
- The game has at least 3-4 sets of choices with 3-4 choices each.
- The story branches based on player choice to multiple unique outcomes and endings.
- The player can name their protagonist and potentially some key NPCs.
- The player will be able to choose a character class, which will have an impact on the story and the player's potential choices.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The project functions as short choose-your-own-adventure game with at least 3-4 sets of choices, each with branching outcomes.
